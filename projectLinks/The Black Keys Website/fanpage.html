        The Black Keys are an American band that play some fire blues rock. They melt minds with their unique blues/rock and roll sound and you should definitely listen to them if you haven't already. Dan Auerbach plays guitar and belts his pipes while Patrick Carney drops the bass on drums.

            <p class="text">
                The duet was formed by longtime friends Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney after they dropped out of college. They met when they were 9 years old and later became friends in high school as they started to jam with ech other. Auerbach wanted to start playing gigs at small bars but knew that him and his band needed a demo to gain rapport.  Auerbach asked for Carney's help after his actual band didn't show up to the scheduled recording. The duo decided to become a band and they made a six song record of "mostly blues ripoffs and words made up on the spot". They sent it out to 12 record companies and ended up accepting an offer from a label called Alive.
